# Chapter 1
## Mine your own business

The pipe let out a plume of silicone, which quickly froze into crystalline droplets. "Gotcha!" muttered 👤Quinn under her breath, holding the titanium pipe wrench with two hands.
"That was two weeks ago", thought 👤Quinn as she emerged from the mineshaft. She gave the customary tap of gratitude to the equipement, and both she and 👤Parker clipped on the 🔧ship's tether and pushed themselves off the 📍asteroid surface, ascending effortlessly like two superheroes without capes.

There's very little gravity on the smaller 📍asteroids, which makes the drilling easier since there's not much to hold things together. Think of a loose snowball of ice and rocks, where you can push things around much more easily because there's no mortar between the bricks, so to speak. Unfortunately, it also makes things a lot more dangerous since your mining shaft can collapse at any time. Hence the automated drilling.
